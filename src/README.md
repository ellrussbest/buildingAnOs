- Assembly is a human readable interpretation of a machine code
- When you compile a program in a programming language such as C or C++, it gets converted into a machine code which is the language that the processor understands
- Assembly makes it easier for us humans to read and write the code
- High level such as C or C++ need to be tranlated by the compiler into machine code
- This will involve multiple steps; like building an abstract syntax tree and huge amount of optimization
- Assembly is much simpler, because the instruction need to be converted into the machine code via a tool called an assembler
